# My First Year as a Ham (as in "Ham Radio")

I've been a ham for about ten months now. I love it, and I have some thoughts on why I love it. I'm going to share them, but fair warning: they are going to be meandering...

## My Introduction to Computing

For me, computing began with an Apple IIc Plus. Via (tragic) means not really germain to this post, my sister got a sum of money to be placed in a trust fund. When my father deposited those funds in the local bank, he was awarded with, among other things, an Apple IIc Plus (the bank was running a promotion trying to increase deposits).

I have vague memories of my father bringing that computer home and hooking it up. It came with a stack of manuals that my father said we had to read before we could use it. He (of course) relented. I had definitely skimmed some of the manuals... but what really caught my attention were the programs in the appendices that I could type in and run. I can't even remember what they did (some simple graphics, I think). I was ten or eleven years old, and I was hooked.

I remember telling my math teacher that I had an Apple IIc plus, and he started sharing software with me. He gave me a word processor on a few floppy disks. I think I had to load it (from floppies) every time I wanted to run it.

I remember my physics teacher, in high school, offering a programming course. This would have been sometime between 1990 and 1994. I still can't believe his foresight. I loved that class.

## My Introduction to the Internet

I graduated high school in 1994 and went to university in the fall. For whatever reason, I chose marketing as a major, but I took computer classes to round out my schedule. I remember being told something like it cost the same whether I take 12 or 18 credits... so I figured taking 18 credits was a bargain. I later switched my major from marketing to finance. In my junior year, I finally declared Computer Science as my second major.

I was introduced to the internet at university. Gopher was winding down (I remember playing around with it a bit) and the world wide web was really starting to take off. I remember switching from Yahoo to Google not because Google's search was better... but because their ads were much less annoying.

I remember using Pidgin instant messenger... and unifying my Yahoo, Microsoft, and AOL instant messaging apps.


## Early use of the internet as a professional

I remember a time when... 
* someone wanted to put something on your calendar, they sent you an ICS attachment. 
* if you found something on the internet, you just copied the link
* when people redesigned websites, they created redirects from legacy urls

## Ham Radio

### Commercialilsation

Okay, so what does all my internet reminiscing have to do with ham radio? Well, I used the internet in its adolescent phase (I wouldn't say I was there for its infancy). It was a time just before commercial interests were getting involved. Most of the people that used the internet was just exploring, and it was wonderful...

There was no real incentive to:
* keep people on your website as long as you could, so:
    * you could link them directly to other content, without having to find a way to keep them on your site
    * give them an ics file to an even you were hosting and let them open it in their own calendar app

These are just some of the downsides that commercialization brings. Inn ham radio, it's illegal, and you'll lose your license.



At the time, businesses had probably barely even heard of the internet. There was no commercial interest in in.


So much to love:
* No commercial interests
* in person meetings
* open to new technology (discord)

What if 127/8 was designated as "amateur IP space" and you got one IP per license? What if the backbone was encouraged to route it, but it was illegal to connect it to "the internet" (I mean the second half of that is already in place -- the backbone doesn't ever let 127/8 connect to the internet).

## Problem solvers

So, I'm an uber-liberal guy... which, at least guaging first impressions, may put me in the minority political view for amateur radio operators. But this is another thing I love about the community. They are problem solvers. And in my experience, people fall on a spectrum that determines how much their own political views prevent them from talking to people with opposing political views. Problem solvers are at the end of the spectrum where "political views can be overlooked". My people.
