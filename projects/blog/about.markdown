## About me
Hi, I'm Ed.

Recently, I've come to the realization that while I'm comfortable with spoken communications, I need to work on my written communication.

It's not that I think I'm a terrible writer. I mean, I wouldn't go so far as to call myself "good" at it -- but I'm not terrible. I could definitely use some practice. My biggest problem, however, is that I just hate doing it!

This website is an attempt to learn to like it.

## What's with this website's name?
Let me prefix this with "I'm not going to pretend to be a Lisp expert, but..."

If you're wondering what the name of this website means, there's a good chance you've never used Lisp. A "cons" is a fundamental Lisp data structure. You can think of it as a pair whose first element contains a value and whose second element contains either a pointer to another cons or a pointer to nil.
