Hi, I'm Ed.

Recently, I've come to the realization that while I'm comfortable with spoken communications, I need to work on my written communication.

It's not that I think I'm a terrible writer. I mean, I wouldn't go so far as to call myself "good" at it -- but I'm not terrible. I could definitely use some practice. My biggest problem, however, is that I just hate doing it!

This website is an attempt to learn to like it.
